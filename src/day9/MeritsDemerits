Q. 15. String is Immutable class. What are the demerits and merits of string being immutable class.


-Multithreading is safe since strings are immutable. The string can be shared between threads without anyone changing it and confusing the others.

-The hash values they contain cannot be changed after the string is created, so they can be used as keys or elements in dictionaries or sets.

Demerits
-If a string has many modifications, they can be less efficient because a new string must be created each time.
